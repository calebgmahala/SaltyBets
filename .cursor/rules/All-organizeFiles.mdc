- Organize code within a file into logical sections.
- When appropriate, use separator comment blocks like
  `
    // ===========================================
    // Field Resolvers
    // ===========================================
  ` to visually group related code.
- If the file grows too large or mixes unrelated logic, consider suggesting a file split with a better structure.
- Follow common organizational patterns in the codebase where possible.
