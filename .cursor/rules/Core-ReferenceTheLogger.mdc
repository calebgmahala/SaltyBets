- Always use the `logger` from `../utils/logger` for logging (never `console.log`).
- Use severity levels like `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `success` appropriately.
- Log important actions, conditions, and results â€” especially errors and decisions.
- Use color helpers like `logger.cyan` for clarity in logs.
- Example format:

```ts
logger.debug(\`Calculating total bets for match \${logger.cyan(match.id)}\`);
logger.success(\`Created match \${logger.cyan(newMatch.id)}\`);
```
